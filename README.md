- [Case Study: Red Bull's Airdrop](https://medium.com/epicagency/airdrop-technical-casestudy-bafabf2f8c1e) - Lot's of technical hoop jumping and problem solving to get an game into Facebook Instand Gamge. Sharing WebGL context (pixi & threeJS), inifinite worlds, post-processing mist.
    - " In many cases, overlaying HTML/CSS on top of canvas will result in performance drops due how the browser handles the compositing phase. "
- [Frame rate independent animation](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-animation.html) - Frame rate independence is a must for any webGL application.

## ThreeJS
- [Intro to vertex shaders](https://medium.com/@Zadvorsky/into-vertex-shaders-594e6d8cd804) and [Three.Bas](https://github.com/zadvorsky/three.bas) - Fast pased series of articles. Basics of WebGL, vertex shaders. And going further and beyond with Three.Bas

- [Case Study: Google Could Inf Experience](https://medium.com/@hellomondaycom/how-we-built-the-google-cloud-infrastructure-webgl-experience-dec3ce7cd209) - Showcases a lot of considerations involved in a webGL project.  And how they solved them.
    - "When setting up post-processing shaders in Three.js, itâ€™s done by setting up a new offscreen render target making the browsers built in anti aliasing unavailable."
- [Intro to Post-processing effects](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/2013/02/intro-to-pixel-shaders-in-three-js/) - Good intro to postprocessing if you already have a basic grasp on shaders. Goes from 0 to 100 in 1.3 seconds.

- [Mathematical notation with JS comparations] - Don't fear academic papers / math notation anymore. 

## Computer Graphics
-  [Computing normals for distorted vertices](https://observablehq.com/@k9/calculating-normals-for-distorted-vertices) - Lots of math jargon that went over my head. With the code at the bottom makes more sense. 

## Javascript
-  [What forces a layout / reflow](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a) - All the ways javascript code triggers the browser to recalculate the style and layout. Batch all of them together
