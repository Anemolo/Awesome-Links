Lots of links I tend to check and share.

## To check out
- [Type of movement Constrains](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/) - Article about different ways to constrain movement 
- [Fruit Ninja Swipe Effect](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/LibGDX-Finger-Swipe#5-anti-aliasing-and-stroke-effects) - Capturing input, smoothing curve, AA and optimizations 
- [Building a Generator](http://www.galaxykate.com/blog/generator.html) - Overview of techniques to build generators. 

## WebGL
- [WebGL Explained](https://chriscourses.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-webgl) - What is webGL, how is it faster and practical uses. 
- [Case Study: Red Bull's Airdrop](https://medium.com/epicagency/airdrop-technical-casestudy-bafabf2f8c1e) - Lot's of technical hoop jumping and problem solving to get an game into Facebook Instand Gamge. Sharing WebGL context (pixi & threeJS), inifinite worlds, post-processing mist.
    - " In many cases, overlaying HTML/CSS on top of canvas will result in performance drops due how the browser handles the compositing phase. "

## ThreeJS
- [Intro to vertex shaders](https://medium.com/@Zadvorsky/into-vertex-shaders-594e6d8cd804) and [Three.Bas](https://github.com/zadvorsky/three.bas) - Fast pased series of articles. Basics of WebGL, vertex shaders. And going further and beyond with Three.Bas 
- [Thread: Performance Tips & Tricks](https://twitter.com/jackrugile/status/966440290885156864) - Good tips for almost any ThreeJS app 
- [Case Study: Google Could Inf Experience](https://medium.com/@hellomondaycom/how-we-built-the-google-cloud-infrastructure-webgl-experience-dec3ce7cd209) - Showcases a lot of considerations involved in a webGL project.  And how they solved them.
    - "When setting up post-processing shaders in Three.js, itâ€™s done by setting up a new offscreen render target making the browsers built in anti aliasing unavailable."
- [Intro to Post-processing effects](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/2013/02/intro-to-pixel-shaders-in-three-js/) - Good intro to postprocessing if you sort of understand shaders already. Goes from 0 to 100 in 1.3 seconds.

## Creative Coding

- [AaronPenne's code](https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art) - Simple and awesome Processing/phyton artwork with code and images. Good for learning if you are able to read phyton. 
- [Kjetil's Generated Space](https://generated.space/) - Amazing sketches, all open source. One of my favorite generative artists.   

## Math & Algorithms
- [Sublucid Geometry](https://zalo.github.io/) - Explains "geometry" algorithms. Visuals, and clear.

## Computer Graphics
-  [Computing normals for distorted vertices](https://observablehq.com/@k9/calculating-normals-for-distorted-vertices) - Lots of math jargon that went over my head. With the code at the bottom makes more sense.
